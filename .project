Description="A fairly complete 6502 development environment with some sample computer configurations. Written entirely in Gambas. Using the JIT it runs at about 4mhz. Not bad! I am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by  Beno√Æt Minisini.\n\nUpdated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device. Improved the Basic device example.\n\nThis was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a few are included are part of the project.\n\nHave fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...\n\nThis requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes first!\n\nUpdated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests"
