Description="A fairly complete 6502/65C02 development environment with some sample computer configurations. Written entirely in Gambas.\nUsing the JIT it runs at about simulated 4mhz. Not too bad!\nThe tiny basic included in this project will run on the kim1 or ct65, it supports, IRQ handlers written in Basic. It allows mutiple Tasks to be spawned in your basic program. More fun.\nV1.1.4\nMany bug fixes, spedd improvements, added Watch window\n\nTinyBasic is now Concurrent Basic, full ipc/task management\n\nV1.1.12\nUpdated to multi task Basic language OS\nImproved em IDE to handle Upper lower case symbols correctly\nNumerous bug fixes\n\nV1.1.11\nUpdated Memory mapping improves speed by 20%\nUpdate Tinybasic IL manages Tasks natively.\n Updated documentation for supported computer emulations\n    and devices.\n\nV1.1.9\nFixed issues with lda abs,X instruction\nupdated Tiny Basic to be fully able to run up to 10 tasks at a time, return stack limited to 16 levels \n\nV1.1.8\nActually include 100doors\nupdated Tiny Basic to support 1) array of variables, 2) added task management and support\nFix 6502 ROL instruction\n\nV1.1.7\nFix 6502 test and set bit instruction, added a tunnels and traps game\nAdd function to tiny basic, multi line : , read text char to Variable\nCleanup Error handling and create verbosity switch to command line\nFixed SEi instruction\nv1.1.6\nupdated tiny basic to support IRQ handlers written in basic\nupdated PIA device to support realtime clock and irq timer\nadded sample programs for clock and irq handler implementation\nFixed update/create of intial files... was failing on first time create of root(6502) directory\nUpdate Such that new devices and Computer Defs are created upon new release\nwithout having to do a -d to update everything.\nAdded New Device:  MMU Memory Management unit.\n\nAdded more help/ better error messages.\nUpdate to work with new Wait implementation.\n\nUpdate to include 65C02 instructions,xa assembler into ~/asm directory\nUpdated fo fix exit in fmain, when stoping or stepping from debugger screen.\n\nUpdated name to em6502, to Match github source\n\nI am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by  Beno√Æt Minisini.\n\nUpdated the Update process, More automatic\n\nUpdated Device set with MMU memory management unit implementation\n\nUpdated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with latest information.\n\nUpdated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the default computer configuration. \n\nUpdated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.\n\nUpdated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device. Improved the Basic device example.\n\nThis was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a few are included are part of the project.\n\nHave fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...\n\nThis requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes first!\n\nV1.1.8\nUpdated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests"
