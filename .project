Description="A fairly complete 6502 development environment with some sample computer configurations. Written entirely in Gambas. Using the JIT it runs at about 4mhz. Not bad!\n\nUpdated name to em6502, to Match github source\n\nI am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by  Beno√Æt Minisini.\n\nUpdated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with latest information.\n\nUpdated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the default computer configuration. \n\nUpdated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.\n\nUpdated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device. Improved the Basic device example.\n\nThis was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a few are included are part of the project.\n\nHave fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...\n\nThis requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes first!\n\nUpdated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests"
