' These are the memory constraints this device will occupy in the 6502 memory map
'

Property MemoryEnd As Long use $MemoryEnd = 0                        ' If this is zero then the device has no mapped memory
Property MemoryLen As Long use $MemoryLen = 0                        ' Length of this memory block

'' If required the Device may request a secondary control address area
'' See MMU for example This is Looked for  by the CPU as configuration time.

'Property IoLength as long  use $IoLength  = 5                       ' IoAddress Space Length
'Property IoRw as integer use $IoRw = 4                              ' the io ports are wr=4, ro=1, wo=2
